      <p class="lead"> You can see the status of nodes. A bookkeeper is helpful for network discovery. It helps discover
          new computers. A worker is a powerful computerm with GPU that can process large files in a short amount of time.
          A broker is an intermediary between a client and a worker. A worker that is unreachable can still be useful if
          it acts as a client. When a file is submitted to a broker, it is stored and redirected later to a worker client.</p>
